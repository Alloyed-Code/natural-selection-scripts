# Natural Selection Scripts
A collection of Python scripts, these experiment with simulating natural selection in artificial systems.

## Hunters and Runners
Two separate types of entities, hunters and runners, naturally select in an “arms race” with each other.

Key Inputs

           h: help menu
    spacebar: pause/unpause
           r: reset terrain
           s: Spawn a new random source // Not implemented or replaced - crashes program
           a: automatically restart simulation if all are dead

Status: Incomplete


## Mines Simulator
Miners compete to collect the most diamonds in the allotted time so that they are the basis for the next generation.

Click on a grid square to cycle once through "diamond", "air", and "earth"

Status: Complete


## Spaceships
Multi-block “spaceships” move with Newtonian physics to survive until the end of the generation.

Key Inputs:

           h: Help Menu
    spacebar: Pause/Unpause
           r: Reset terrain
           s: Spawn a new random source  // Not implemented or replaced - crashes program
           a: Automatically restart simulation if all are dead

Status: Incomplete


## Synthetic Bases
Structures starting from a single cell build outwards to collect both sunlight and minerals.

Key Inputs:

           h: Help Menu
    Spacebar: Pause/Unpause
           r: Reset terrain
           s: Spawn a new random source
           a: Automatically restart simulation if all are dead

Note: The different versions of this simulator function under different conditions and will produce different outcomes. They also have varying levels of console command functionality. Earlier versions may not respond to certain key inputs.

Status: Complete

## The Petri
Does not successfully start.

Status: Incomplete


## Underground Organisms
Similar to the Synthetic Bases, these grow their structuren to collect minerals before reproducing.

Key Inputs:

           h: Help Menu
    Spacebar: Pause/Unpause
           r: Reset terrain
           s: Spawn a new random source
           a: Automatically restart simulation if all are dead

Status: Complete
